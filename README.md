# Indian-cricketers-image-classifier-project
Built a machine learning model to classify images of Indian cricketers (e.g., Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, MS Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar) using facial recognition techniques.
Utilized the OpenCV library for image preprocessing and Haarcascade classifiers for accurate face and eye detection.
Extracted facial features and trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, achieving 90% prediction accuracy.
Focused on optimizing model performance through feature tuning and data augmentation techniques.
